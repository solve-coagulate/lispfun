# Toy Interpreter

The `toy` directory contains a small Lisp interpreter implemented entirely in
Lisp.  It includes a tokenizer, parser and evaluator so once `eval2` is loaded
the system runs without relying on the Python implementation.  `run_toy.py`
loads these pieces and starts a REPL written in Lisp.
