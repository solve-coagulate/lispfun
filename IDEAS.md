# Future LispFun Enhancements

This file collects ideas for features we would like to implement. Development is
now focused on improving the Lisp toy interpreter found in
`docs/toy_interpreter.md`.

- **Loop constructs** such as `while` or `for` to complement recursive iteration.
- **Quasiquote and unquote** to simplify macro writing.
- **Module system** for organizing code and supporting imports.
- **File I/O primitives** for reading from and writing to files within Lisp.
- **Exception handling** to manage runtime errors gracefully.
- **Full self-hosting**: run the Lisp evaluator written in Lisp using itself.
- **Expanded standard library** providing utilities beyond the basic list functions.
